This project is a quite old school project, aiming to develop a very simple game in Java controlled by mind, using the neural headset [Emotiv](https://www.emotiv.com/epoc/).


## Disclaimer
1 - This is an old code, I will very certainly refactor it someday, but this might not be done anytime soon (I currently can not use the neural headset). Everything should works, but I prefer not to guarantee.
