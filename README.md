This project is a quite old school project, aiming to develop a very simple game in Java controlled by mind, using the neural headset [Emotiv](https://www.emotiv.com/epoc/).  
The game is composed of 3 levels:
- 1: The main character automatically moves from left to right, and can meet some obstacles (cubes) on his way. He needs to think "disappear" to clear the path.
- 2: Same as above, without automatic move. The user needs to think "Right" to move to the right of the screen, and, then, being able to make the obstacles disappear.
- 3: Same as above, with the "Left" move too.


## Requirements
Make sure to add the required libraries (_.dll_ and _.jar_), as listed in `lib/libraries_list.txt`.


## Disclaimer
This is an old code, I will very certainly refactor it someday, but this might not be done anytime soon (I currently can not use the neural headset). Everything should works, but I prefer not to guarantee.
